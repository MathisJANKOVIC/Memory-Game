Memory Game is a video game on browser. The game consists of pairs of cards with identical illustrations. The set of cards is mixed and displayed. You will then have to return two cards of your choice by clicking on them. If both cards are identical, they remain visible faces. If the cards are not the same, the cards go back to hidden faces.
